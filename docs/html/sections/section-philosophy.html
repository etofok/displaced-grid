        RTS games gathered a large following because of their multilayered complexity.

        They're fun.
        
        They're difficult.
        
        Cognitively and mechanically - it's fun to control everything.
        
        But it's hard to control everything <b><i>well</i></b>.

        The intelligence that attracts players to strategy games also makes us aware of our errors.

        We want to see ourselves succeed in battle - not fail miserably because of poor management.

        The gap between intent and execution sometimes gets too painful to tolerate.


        RTS games have a relatively inactive <u>player</u>base compared to their audiences.

        People enjoy good games.

        But because they don't enjoy their own play - "too difficult", "too stressful" - 

        they demote themselves from the commander to a viewer.

        No shame in that dear.


        But it seems like if we want to create an RTS with active <u>player</u>base - 

        we need to design around <b>accessibility of <u>play</u></b>.

        And therefore - we need a great interface.

        Displaced Grid is my attempt at that.


        Warcraft 3 is one of the godfathers of competitive gaming.

        And it comes to no surprise that it's one of the most hotkey-intensive games there is.

        At 200 Actions-Per-Minute and your average game length of about 15 minutes...

        We are looking at 3000+ actions <i>per game</i>.

        How many games an active player might have in one day? 

        In a week? Over the years?..

        Why use a hotkey layout designed for ergonomics...of 2001?

        <span class="textunderneath">Windows Millennium, released during Warcraft 3 development in 2000</span>

        There is a gap between what we <b>want</b> to do in-game... and what we <b>can actually</b> do.

        <span class="textunderneath">the gap between the 'intent' and the 'execution'</span>

        Fighting your controls more than fighting your opponent is a very... special type of fun.

        I believe this is the <b>biggest drawback</b> of RTS games - the controls.

        Especially for slower players, 

        which is - by the way - <b>99%</b> of all players.


        Displaced Grid is my attempt to showcase what's possible, 

        and to make people realize how much better the experience can be.

        I have no hopes of working on the actual game, but I can make impact with this work.


        At the very least, 

        I had a lot of fun designing and developing this project,

        And!..

        I replayed <i>all the campaigns</i> with a very comfortable interface :)

        Display Grid is not a part of the game. 

        It doesn't even see the game. 

        So the layout is limited to rearranging the native GRID layout, because we want Ability QuickCasts which only work with native GRID.

        And yet, 

        Displaced Grid is faster and more comfortable to play on.

        It makes a big difference. 

        Try it out.


        The package also comes with 9 extra modules.

        All modules are extras.

        All modules are optional and can be disabled entirely.

        Modules follow the same logic of 'bridging the gap' explained earlier.

        Each module is a set of macros that emulate a behavior.

        Displaced Grid is not a part of the game.

        It doesn't see anything.

        The fact that these modules somehow work is both a miracle and a travesty.
